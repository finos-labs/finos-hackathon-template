## Using DCO to sign your commits

**All commits** must be signed with a DCO signature to avoid being flagged by the DCO Bot. This means that your commit log message must contain a line that looks like the following one, with your actual name and email address:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```
